Git Overview
Git is a version control system used for saving the history of a project. It allows us to track changes made to files and folders, view previous versions, and identify who made specific changes. Git provides features for managing project history effectively.

Key Concepts

Repository: A folder where all changes to a project are saved. It serves as a centralized location for tracking project history.
Commit: A commit represents a specific snapshot of the project at a given point in time. It captures changes made to files and folders.
Branch: A separate line of development within a repository. It allows for the isolation of new features or changes before merging them into the main branch.
Remote: A remote refers to a version of the repository hosted on a server, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
Git Commands
Initializing a Git Repository:
To start tracking changes in a project folder, use the command: git init.
Tracking Changes:
Add untracked files to the staging area using: git add . (to add all files) or git add <filename> (to add specific files).
Commit changes to the repository with a descriptive message: git commit -m "Commit message".
Viewing and Managing Changes:
Check the status of the repository: git status.
View the project's commit history: git log.
Undo staged changes: git restore --staged <filename>.
Remove files: rm -rf <filename> (for local files) or git rm <filename> (for tracked files).
Working with Remote Repositories:
Link a local repository to a remote repository: git remote add origin <remote_url>.
Push changes to a remote repository: git push origin <branch_name>.
Pull changes from a remote repository: git pull origin <branch_name>.
GitHub and Collaboration
GitHub is a popular platform for hosting Git repositories and enables collaboration among developers. Key points to note include:
Forking a Repository: You can create a personal copy (fork) of a project hosted on GitHub to make changes independently.
Pull Requests: When you want to contribute changes to the original repository, you submit a pull request. This allows the project owner to review and merge your changes.
Managing Branches: It is recommended to create separate branches for each feature or change to maintain a clean and organized history.
Resolving Merge Conflicts: If multiple contributors make changes to the same lines of code, merge conflicts may occur. These conflicts need to be manually resolved by carefully combining the changes.
Additional Git Operations
Stashing Changes: Temporarily save unsaved changes without committing using git stash. Changes can later be reapplied with git stash pop.
Reverting Commits: If you need to undo specific commits, you can use git reset <commit_id>. This action removes the commits after the specified one.
Squashing Commits: Combine multiple commits into a single commit using git rebase -i <commit_id>. Squashing commits helps maintain a cleaner commit history.
Git and GitHub Collaboration Workflow
When working with Git and GitHub, it is important to follow a structured collaboration workflow. The following steps outline a typical workflow:
a. Forking the Repository:

Fork the original repository on GitHub to create a personal copy under your account.
This allows you to freely experiment with changes without impacting the original project.
b. Cloning the Repository:

b. Cloning the Repository:

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the git clone <repository_url> command.
This creates a local copy of the project that you can work on.
c. Creating a New Branch:

Before making changes, create a new branch to isolate your work from the main branch. Use the command git branch <branch_name> to create a new branch.
Switch to the new branch with git checkout <branch_name>.
d. Making and Committing Changes:

Make the necessary changes to files in your project folder.
Use git add <filename> to stage the modified files for commit.
Commit your changes using git commit -m "Commit message" to create a new commit.
e. Pushing Changes to GitHub:

Push your local branch and commits to your forked repository on GitHub using git push origin <branch_name>.
This will make your changes available on GitHub.
f. Creating a Pull Request:

Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click on the "New Pull Request" button.
Select the appropriate branches for the base (original repository) and compare (your branch).
Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request.
Submit the pull request to notify the project owner of your changes.
g. Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests:

The project owner or designated collaborators will review your pull request.
They may provide feedback, request changes, or approve the request.
Once approved, the project owner can merge your changes into the main branch.
h. Syncing with the Original Repository:

To keep your forked repository up to date with the original repository, you need to sync the changes.
Add the original repository as an upstream remote using git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>.
Fetch the latest changes from the original repository: git fetch upstream.
Merge the changes into your local branch: git merge upstream/main.
Push the updated branch to your forked repository: git push origin <branch_name>.
